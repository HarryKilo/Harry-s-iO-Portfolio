                <p> <b>About Me</b> <br> I’m a web developer based in Bristol, England. In the past I’ve worked in shops and offices and classrooms, before retraining and finding my digital feet, here, with a whole new set of skills.
                     <br> <br> Outside of work, I like to spend time with my family, cook and play a bit of Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
